I wasn't able to find any non-mechanical examples of sychronization

* Kuramoto: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lac4TxWyBOg>

For the purposes of identifying a metric that detects Kuramoto, the cause of the sychronization could be ignored.

Given multiple time series, each with oscillating state, look for pair-wise correlations within a temporal window.
